React Native BLE & Charting Demo
This project is a technical assessment designed to showcase key mobile development capabilities using React Native. The application demonstrates two core features: real-time, two-way data communication with a hardware device using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and data visualization through a heat map chart.

‚ú® Key Features
This application successfully implements the two main requirements of the assessment:

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Communication:

Built with the react-native-ble-manager library.

Performs scanning for nearby BLE peripherals.

Establishes a connection to a real BLE device based on its UUID.

Discovers the device's services and characteristics.

Demonstrates two-way communication by sending string data to the peripheral and receiving string data back.

Data Visualization:

Includes a screen displaying a heat map chart.

The chart is populated with placeholder data to demonstrate data visualization capabilities.
